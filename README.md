# FastMotion-merge-ffmpeg
This program was written in gimp-fu.  It allows input of video filename, folder,number of files to skip, acceleration factor and outputs merged frames and a bool button option to print special effect.  It is all basically a video special effect.  The script allows a fast motion with more detail but only works on completely stable video like when using a tripod.  I currently have to manually intput frame size.
