# FastMotion-merge-ffmpeg
This program was written in gimp-fu.  It allows input of video filename, folder,number of files to skip,acceleration factor and outputs merged frames and a bool button option to print special effect.  It is all basically a video special effect.  The "special effect" option was an error that created interesting distortion of color, especially in the sky and clouds.  The error was from suaring in Uint8 field rather than in a field defined as float.  The script allows a fast motion with more detail but only works on completely stable video like when using a tripod.  I currently have to manually intput frame size.
